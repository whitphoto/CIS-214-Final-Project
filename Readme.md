This is my final project for CIS 214: Programing with C++.
It is intended to be a comprehensive practical final exam,
incorporating all of the concepts we've learned since the 
beginning of class, using proper programming techniques and
documentation. Requirements included encapsulation, inheritance, 
and overloaded methods. To prove our understanding of OOP we 
were instructed to put as little as possible in the Main.CPP
file, preferably only method calls and instantiations. In 
addition to these requirements my program reads and writes to 
text files, validates user input, includes exception handling,
is formated for readability and has been commented in an effort 
to make maintaining and expanding it easier. 

This program is an example of an inventory report program for a 
grocery or convenience store. It reads records in from an inventory
text file, sorts the inventory items into three separate arrays
based on item type and then prints out reports as the user requests 
them. Choices include all inventory items broken down by category, 
only produce, bread or drink items, and any items which have a 0 
stock level. The program will write these reports to txt files and
display them to the screen. The program will also print out labels.

Menu's include an option to return to the main menu which includes 
an option to quit the program. Users input is validated and if the 
user enters an invalid choice a error message will be displayed and 
they are returned to the menu they were on. 

This program included enough extra credit features to earn an exemption 
from the final exam and an A for the course.
